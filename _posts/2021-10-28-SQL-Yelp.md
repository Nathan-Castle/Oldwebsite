# Part 1: Profiling and Understanding 
Using basic SQL query techniques to understand the different tables

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM attribute

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(*)) AS total_unique_records
FROM business

Understanding if there are any NULL values in the columns for the user table
SELECT id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos
FROM user
WHERE id = NULL or name = NULL or review_count = NULL or yelping_since = NULL or useful = NULL or funny = NULL or cool = NULL or fans= NULL or average_stars= NULL or compliment_hot= NULL or compliment_more= NULL or compliment_profile= NULL or compliment_cute= NULL or compliment_list= NULL or compliment_note= NULL or compliment_plain = NULL or compliment_cool= NULL or compliment_funny= NULL or compliment_writer= NULL or compliment_photos= NULL;

Understanding the average stars per all restaurant in the reviews table
SELECT MIN(stars) AS min_stars,
    MAX(stars) AS max_stars,
    AVG(stars) AS mean_stars
FROM review

Finding the cities with the most reviews
SELECT b.city,
    SUM(b.review_count)
FROM business b 
GROUP BY b.city
ORDER BY SUM(b.review_count) DESC

Finding the distribution of star ratings in the city of Avon
SELECT stars,
    COUNT(stars) as count_stars
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Avon'
GROUP BY stars

Does posting more reviews correlate with more fans?
SELECT name,
    review_count,
    fans
FROM user
ORDER BY review_count DESC

As table below illustrates, posing more reviews does not necessarily correlate with more fans. For example, although, Gerald has posed the most reviews, he has fewer fans in comparison with Mimi. Therefore, sorting the users in descending order based on their total number of reviews does not sort the fans in the same order, meaning that there is not a correlation between the total number of reviews and number of fans.

Subquery to find number of hate and love reviews
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(text)
        FROM review
        WHERE text like '%love%') AS love,
        (SELECT COUNT(text)
        FROM review
        WHERE text like '%hate%') AS hate


```
