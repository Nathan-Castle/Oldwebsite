## Background

I am a 5th year student majoring in business with concentrations in finance and management information systems. Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in statistics with an emphasis on statistical analysis in data science.

Throughout my university experience, I have always found a passion for courses that delved deeper into the quantitative world. However, I was always unsure how to apply these skills to real jobs and projects. At the beginning of 2021, I was exposed to utilizing these skills in my first technical programming class where we used R to build a diabetes risk prediction model with the basics of machine learning. I found all aspects of analysis, coding, and presentation to be thoroughly enjoyable. Specifically, the emphasis of the project was to communicate our findings to relevant stakeholders and bridge the gap between the technical and business world. I excelled at all these roles and immediately fell in love with the notion of having my analysis being used as an aid to make complex business decisions. 

From here, I transitioned out of my accounting career and into a more data-driven role as a Finance Analyst. Within my role, I am constantly performing data analysis on internal projects to help drive decisions within the company.

## About Me
Outside of work and school, I am always trying to improve my technical acumen by working on personal projects with the use of either R, Python, SQL or Tableau. Additionally, I try to improve my critical thinking and presentation skills by participating in hackathons or case competitions. 

When my life is not revolved around work/school/projects, I spend most of my time being a dog father as I recently got my first sheltie! His favourite thing to do is run circles around everyone until he is tired. Moreover, I enjoy being outside playing soccer and exploring Vancouver. However, when I am trying to relax, I like playing chess and games with friends.
