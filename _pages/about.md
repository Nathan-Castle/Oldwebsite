## Background

I am a 5th year student majoring in Business with concentrations in Finance and Management Information Systems. Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in Statistics with an emphasis on statistical analysis in Data Science.

With this unique background I am currently in a career transition from Accounting and Finance into the data world. This website is part of my Data Science journey to keep track of my projects and different posts related to data and tech.

Throughout my university experience I have always found a passion for courses that delved deeper into the quantitative world, but was unsure how to apply these skills to real jobs and projects. At the beginning of 2021 I was exposed to utilizing these skills in my first technical programming class where we used R to build a diabetes risk prediction model. Not only did I find the coding and analysis enjoyable, but the emphasis of the project was to communicate our findings to relevant stakeholders and bridge the gap between the technical and business world. I excelled at both portions and immediately fell in love with the notion of having my analysis being used as an aid to make complex business decisions. 

From here, I transitioned out of my accounting career and into a more data driven role as a Finance Analyst. Within my role, I am constantly performing data analysis on internal projects to help drive decisions within the company.

In the middle of 2021 I became a proud owner of my first ever sheltie!
