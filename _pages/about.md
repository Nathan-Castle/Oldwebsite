I am currently in career transition from applied research to Data Science. `Cross-validated` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different HOWTOs related to Data Science and tech.

My background is hybrid â€“ I am passionate about numbers and analytics, but also have management and consulting experience.

I am looking for job opportunities where I can help companies **optimize marketing and product development** by delivering actionable data insights using **Python, SQL and Tableau** (or similar technologies). 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto: kbosko@cross-validated.com) if you find my blog useful, think I might be a good fit or simply would like to connect.

## My Background
I was born and grew up in Ukraine and lived in Germany for almost 10 years. Since 2018 I live in California, the US.

I have a PhD in Political Science (2017) and developed strong **analytical, communication and management skills** throughout my almost 10 years career in Applied Policy Research in Germany. 

I have published over 40 analytical articles and gave over 30 public talks and lectures (see the full list under [Achievements](/achievements/)). So I know how to communicate results to different audiences. I also consulted and provided expertise on Ukrainian politics to German media, interested public and other stakeholders.

For almost 5 years I worked in a similar to a **Product Manager role in academic setting** - I was a Managing Editor of online analytical digest ["Ukraine-Analysen"](https://www.laender-analysen.de/ukraine-analysen/) (3500+ subscribers) with two weeks publication deadlines. 

In this role, I wore many hats:

- **Strategic Planning** - defined the strategic direction of the digest based on our mission, in response to hot topics, subscriber's interests, technological and financial resources available; built editorial calender
- **Collaborate & Coordinate** - built relationships with potential authors/researchers worldwide (lead generation); coordinated the processes of proofreading, translation and layout
- **Day-to-day Management** -  implemented a content strategy: contacted authors, enforced deadlines and budget requirements, ensured quality and style compliance 
- **Write & Edit** - wrote a number of analytical articles myself and edited authors' submissions when necessary
- **Data Visualizations & Asset Creation** - collected, analyzed and visualized data on key topics of each issue (opinion polls, reviews of press coverage, statistical data, etc.).
- **Digital Analytics** - monitored the key metrics (Click-through-Rates, Open Rates, Bounce Rates, Pageviews, Unsubscribes, etc) on a regular basis 
- **Marketing Online and Offline** - increased digest's awareness at different public events where I was invited as a speaker; responsible for social media posts and website updates
